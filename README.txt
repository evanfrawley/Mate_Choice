Evan Frawley - Mate Choice Simulator

This is a project that is being developed for Frazer Meacham, a graduate student of the Bergstrom
theoretical biology lab at the University of Washington. The purpose of this project is to simulate
a population over a given number of generations. We are examining how the frequency of alleles
changes over each generation, and which factors have substantial influence over how the frequencies
of the alleles / preferences change.

I am using Java to code this simulation. The goal is to have each of the "mates" be randomly assigned
to an index in an array. Similar to hashing, I will use a separate chain to maintain the order that
the mates were entered if they collide on the same index.
